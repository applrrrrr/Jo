The space between walls is 16cm and the walls are all 0.02m thick (0.01m on each side). So the cell size is 18cm*18cm with walls and 16cm*16cm without walls. 
Also there are 16 columns and 16 rows in the maze. Thus the maze is of dimensions 16*16 with each cell of dimension 18*18. So, the number of cells is 256.
